Young Rich Nigga, I call the plug, I'm finessing
I'm strapped up with the smith and wesson, I'm taking yo blessings
Smoking a Michael Vick 7, preach to these niggas like reverends
No Jason and Freddy, I keep the Machete
I'm taking a trip to Quebec to go pick up that check
Nigga no UPS but he mail it, wrap that bitch up and I scale it
Stand on the block and I sale it, selling more dope than them niggas in Belly
The niggas after me, I'm Makaveli
She popping the molly, she rollin' like Kelly, she sweating
She can't stop touching and talking and feeling on me
All this jewelry on me, it's kinda hard to see
