[Verse 1]
You, you hate, you hate me
You, you hate, you hate me
You, you hate, you hate me
You, you hate, you hate me
You, you hate, you hate me, you hate me
You hate me to say, you hate me to say
You hate me to say and I did not obey

[Chorus]
Will you until death does sever
Be upright to her forever?
Never, never
Will you until death does sever
Be upright to her forever?
Never, never

[Verse 2]
Du, du hast, du hast mich
Du, du hast, du hast mich
Du, du hast, du hast mich, du hast mich
Du hast mich gefragt, du hast mich gefragt
Du hast mich gefragt und ich hab' nichts gesagt
[Chorus]
Will you until death does sever
Be upright to her forever?
Never, never
Will you 'til death be her rider
Her lover too, to stay inside her?
Never, never
Will you until death does sever
Be upright?
Never, never6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
