You ain't ever lived that life, you ain't ever lived that life
Talkin bout what you did, you ain't lived that life
You ain't never lived that life, you ain't ever lived that life
Talkin bout your 10 year money, nigga you ain't ever even lived that life
Talkin bout that  stuntin, nigga you ain't ever lived that life
You ain't ever lived that life, you ain't ever lived that life
You ain't ever lived that life, you ain't ever lived that life
Talkin bout you got 2 bad bitches in a 2 door Coope, ou ain't lived that life
Talkin bout you got  you ain't lived that life

Quavo!
Nigga you ain't even ever flipped bricks
Nigga you ain't ever even hit a lick
Nigga you ain't in the VIP
Poppin bottles with a foreign chick
Nigga I been on money savage
Nigga I always had karots
Nigga you ain't even got no swag
Nigga you ain't even ran from the task
Nigga you ain't even did your job
On the block gotta hustle hard
I'm on the block  like Michael, 
Nigga your VV don't shine
At least not hotter than mine
Like  droppin dimes
Y'all niggas gon waste my time
Where I'm going 
 I might get signed
But only 1 contract
Fuck around, shit nigga I was counting racks
Got foreign hoes rolling up the pack
Nigga you ain't even had that
Got 3 hoes in the back
Nigga you ain't ever seen that
You ain't ever lived that life, you ain't ever lived that life
Talkin bout what you did, you ain't lived that life
You ain't never lived that life, you ain't ever lived that life
Talkin bout your 10 year money, nigga you ain't ever even lived that life
Talkin bout that  stuntin, nigga you ain't ever lived that life
You ain't ever lived that life, you ain't ever lived that life
You ain't ever lived that life, you ain't ever lived that life
Talkin bout you got 2 bad bitches in a 2 door Coope, ou ain't lived that life
Talkin bout you got  you ain't lived that life

Offset!
You ain't ever seen a nigga like me
 bands 
Y'all niggas ain't ever keep it G
If you did, might be something I ain't see
Young nigga ain't ever pull up in a blue Mustang with the leather seats
Got a lot, push start, no key
You ain't ever bought VV's
no ly, never sold no keys
Never walked in sets with a pocket full of money, walking out with Luie Double G's
Everything you say is fishy
Counting Benjies, you still counting 
We did every word in the 
Getting tickets, from moving chickens
 putting young niggas on the mission
I be killing  lil niggas, I deserve a 20 year sentence
You need to stop, stop lying
You ain't ever not snitched through your time
 you ain't ever had to grind
Take your bitch, and make her mine
You ain't ever lived that life, you ain't ever lived that life
Talkin bout what you did, you ain't lived that life
You ain't never lived that life, you ain't ever lived that life
Talkin bout your 10 year money, nigga you ain't ever even lived that life
Talkin bout that  stuntin, nigga you ain't ever lived that life
You ain't ever lived that life, you ain't ever lived that life
You ain't ever lived that life, you ain't ever lived that life
Talkin bout you got 2 bad bitches in a 2 door Coope, ou ain't lived that life
Talkin bout you got  you ain't lived that lifeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
