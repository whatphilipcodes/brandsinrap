It's Money boy here

No wait for you
We have a problem
Don't you worry
I am about to wish you
Alone 4x

No excuses somehow
We have No Excuses
Understood Wit'em
We have no excuses

Be a porn star oh god it's liquid
I like the way you milk like quit it
You know it was hypocrite, this was never legit
You know my math skills wit' digit when i pig it
Out like Porky Pig did? when i was careful
I learn move skills, damn, this was wonderful
The dick was the same rat like kitchen in hell
Do you mind that bch into my way to sell
Money Boy doesn't offer clothes in the mall
Do the team you play and like what the hell
Who doesn't play the terms way too much
Stay important
We leave it
Whole day
We have a problem
