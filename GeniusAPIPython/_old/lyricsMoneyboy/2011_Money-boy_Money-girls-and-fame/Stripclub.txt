Ayy, bang
Bang bang, bang bang
Sos' baby, Glo gang baby
You know how we rockin' baby

Ayy, been gettin' money since '08 summer, I been riding hunnids
That ain't nothin', that ain't nothin'
I been getting money, I been spending money, boy, that's little money
That ain't nothin', that ain't nothin'
Made it out the 'jects now I'm on a jet
Still throwing up my set
DJ Khaled, we the best
With Wop on Bouldercrest
That's the way show no stress
That's your bitch, she showin' stress
It ain't nothing, it's a test, nigga

Pull up in that wet, throwin' up my set
Hot shit you get wet nigga, It ain't none of that nigga
It ain't none of this, what you want with this
You don't war with this where ya boys is
Hit that bank on that Lloyd shit grown boy shit
Pistol knock your ass out it be on that Floyd shit
In my lane bunch of bullshit, I can do it
By my pistol I'm a scoot it at your booty
In ya head now your dead nigga
Where ya bread nigga
In the field, where ya lead nigga
Yous a dead nigga
In my hands, it's some bread nigga
I throw bread niggas
When I leave, in the strip club

Shawty Lo I done dun dun dun all these hoes
How we roll, we gone come through and stop the show
Vaminos where my fuckin' bread then I'm out the door
Out ya hair in my fuckin' whip they like where he go, aye
Been gettin' money since '08 summer, I been riding hunnids
That ain't nothin', that ain't nothin'

That ain't nothin', that ain't nothin'
Made it out the 'jects now I'm on a jet
