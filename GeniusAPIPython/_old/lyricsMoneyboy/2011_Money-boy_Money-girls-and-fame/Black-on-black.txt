Lurkin' in the night I'm on the prowl
Finna juug the weedman for his ounce
You niggas is some clones man, nothing more
Your bitch call my phone but she get ignored
Bitch I'm on LSD I'll call you when I'm bored
I got these fiends on my line askin' when I get more
I'm finna re-up as we speak
LSD on me, serving niggas for a fee
Fuck a relationship, I'm focused on stacking cheese
I'm something like birth control, your bitch prescribed to me
Never switch up see it in my face
Free my damn cousin, he ain't beat the case
That damn LSD got me seeing things
Bitches stop lyin', hope I see the day
Life is a game and it's free to play
Black on black shawty with the gold wrist
Young ass nigga wit' a old bitch
These niggas thirsty for that fame, sell they soul quick
I'm underground nigga, no paparazzi
I gave my bitch drugs so she climb on top me
Anime bitch, yeah, she look gothic
Pok√©mon pimpin', catching new bitches
Vodka in my cup, Robitussin mixin'
Bitch, I'm solo dolo you don't know the vision
To hear my damn music that's a fucking privilege
I got a white bitch, she know her position
I'm not atheist and I'm not Christian
Sold my soul to Earth, now I'm fuckin living
Droppin' acid tabs, distortin' my vision
The rap game's fucking lost I reported it missing
Gold on my wrist, I wanna be a pimp
Obey my command bitch, smoke weed and strip
Let me see your tits, let me see your clit
Goth money, bitch, man I'm so depressed
Sad boys, nigga, man I rarely eat
Rarely get sleep fuck them scary dreams
Tell Miley Cyrus come marry me
We gon' fuck on stage at my next show
Never gonna happen, I don't have a show
I got a weakness for thots and the plastic hoes
She got surgery on her face, girl suck my dick
I swear karma like a virgin 'cause it's coming quick

Hotbox my room when my mom gone
Damn I need my own crib, I'm tryna fuck a bitch
Nah I ain't a thug, boy I'm just a plug
LSD shawty, put that on your tongue
Tell me what you feel, tell me what you see
Bet you see the based world, shouts out Lil B
Four grams nigga in that fucking dutch
That's a mutated worm, that ain't a fucking blunt
I'm gon' take a puff get high like the Sun
Think you gettin' money, boy is you dumb?
USA got control of that fuckin' cash
It don't matter how much money in my fucking stash
I could sell a million tabs of that LSD
That's like a motherfucking dollar to the G.O.V
Government, I'm screamin' fuck that
Bitch, I'm making music, man fuck rap
All you mainstream rappers need a dunce cap
Finna roll up and smoke 'em like a blunt wrap
Bitch, I'm Star Trek I fuck with goth money
She open up her legs, she must want top from me
Lick it down the middle I'm a fucking freak
It's drippin' out her legs and it's on my sheets
Bitch, if you ever cheat I'ma break your teeth
I'ma take the metal bat, I'ma break his knees
Then commit suicide 'cause I hate to breathe
I'm runnin' up a hill, squad on my back
Niggas countin' on me, bitch, I'm God on the track
Niggas plottin' on me, bitch, I know you want my pack
Niggas plottin' on me, gotta watch my fucking back
Might be my own nigga that'll stab my back
Tell your girlfriend get back please

Black hat, black shirt with the black jeans
Black shoes, black socks with the black skin
Claim that you're real but you actin'
Fuck gettin' fame, I got a passion1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
