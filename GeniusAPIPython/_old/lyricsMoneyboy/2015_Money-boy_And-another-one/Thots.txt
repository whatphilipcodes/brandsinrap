Yo, fuh that puh
Listen, uh

Yeah, it's Friday the 13th
Dashie is so mean, Dashie is so lean
Dashie is so clean, I spit a sixteen
Hit you so hard, it'll bust your whole spleen
Uh, yeah, I know Kung-Fu
Kick you in the chest, clean up on aisle two
Then he gon' be like- "Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo"
Man, you better go and get some toilet tissue
Oops, I mean toilet paper out
Water is out, you know what I'm about
I don't play around, but if you wanna test me
Trust, your boy can go all ten rounds!

Round two, night of consumers
Uh, I got a pooper (What?)
After that, I'm a looper
Shoot from the three-point line, that's a swish (Ha-ha!)
Uh, I got a lot of swiss
That's cheese, oh, that's money
Boy, you looking kinda funny
I jump high, we call them bunnies
In this town in the night, that's me, I'm breathing
Talk that shit, even I get your 
Huh, dri-dri-drippin', like a faucet
So much blood, you can't stop it
Let me switch the topic, let me get my money up
Niggas talking all that shit, better get your funny up
Sick of the jokes and I'm sick of the nonsense
Bet you get my damn sense
That's money, my dividend
Niggas taking shit, I give you a backhand
Half right, it's on sight
Ain't gon' fight, bitch, I'm gon' snipe

Eugh, night of the Consumers
Y'all niggas calling me a 'boomer'
But I don't feel that, though
I'm not fifty fucking years old, (eh)
Uh, I'm only twenty-seven
Hope I don't die, if I die, go to Heaven
Uh, say "What's up?" to Jesus
(Facts!)
Yo, I'm working at the grocery store, setting up the racks
You know what it is, I might throw it back
If the beat fire, if the donos rolling through
If the beat fire, I might do something to you
If that beat fire, I got the toolie on my loop
My belt loop
I don't have no toolies
The only toolie I got, bro, is school dri-uh, school drivers?
Maybe I am a boomer
Big challenge completed
