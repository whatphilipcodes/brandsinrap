HOOK
Please don't mind my kicks...
I've been running this game since six...
X 4
....
VERSE 1
Ain't nobody out here, that can do it like me
Ball headed nigga, I ain't working for free
With the team...
Everytime I gotta roll up my sleeves
Fire spittin dragon gotta earn his degrees
....
Boy I'm black... skin
Check out the ac... cent
Am I who u ima... gine
Fuck Fa... shion
Fuck what they ask... Ing
....#
I don't like ur tone nigga...
Why u picking fights nigga...
U can't handle this heat
Burn at a 1000 degrees...
I get Respect overseas...
Ain't no way that working with me
Dog off the leash
GOD is in who I believe
But sometimes it feels likе me
Lost in the GEE...
Everybody smеlls like weed...
....#
Lone Wolf...
Counting my sheep like, oh look
Make Money in my sleep
Thats a bold move...
She want me now
Tell that whore move...

Brandon black... Pass the stacks...
I need money boy... why u mad
Don't make me laugh
Puff, Puff Pass...
Gun to your head better give me that Cash
....
I don't like Gucci
Not too many friends like Uzi
If I do die then sue me...
Money to the booty
I do not judge the newbies...
Kicking her curves like Bruce Lee
....
20 to a dollar...
Way too broke... Better chit chat guala
I don't like whores... when I text they'll Hala
Back on the bed better call me PAPA
....
Looking at the man in the mirror
Ain't no body looking this clearerEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
