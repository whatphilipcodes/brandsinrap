I could stay in bed all day if
I allowed me to (If I allowed me to)
In a sweatsuit, hair tied with no makeup on (With no makeup on)
Watchin' Netflix and chillin' with you (That's what I wanna do)
'Cause that's just how I do it
I really be coolin'
Got Juicy all over my booty
My boo, he got on that Gucci
No panties under my sweatpants
He said he got plans to do me
I stepped in in a dirty pair of red Vans
I don't give a damn how you view me
'Cause I would rather be comfy as can be
Sippin' on some tea, smokin' hella weed
I just be takin' it slow and you already know
I say fuck a dress code, I might pull up in a robe
'Cause I'm cozy
I'm so chill that I might make it snow
And you already know me
Once I'm chillin', I won't ever go
'Cause I'd rather be cozy, you know me
Got snakes on both feet, you know me
My pants saggin' and baggy just like Girbauds be
You know I keep it cute and cozy
You know me
Cozy girl, yeah
Cozy girl, yeah
Cozy girl for life
Cozy girl, CG4L
Cozy girl, I'm raw as hell
Cozy girl, oh, can't you tell?
Cozy girl, oh, can't you tell?
All my bitches rockin' platforms, these ain't no stilettos (Yeah)
If we stomp you out, we gon' leave you hella jello (Stomp you out)
We only smoke on Backwoods, please don't bring no 'rellos (Don't bring those)
Money phone ring, I pick it up and I say, "Hello" (Hello, yeah)
I keep it cozy (Yeah), I keep it cozy (Yeah), I keep it cozy
Got snakes on both feet, got snakes on both feet
Got snakes on both feet, got snakes on both, but I could never be a ho
Stomp that ho, I stomp that ho, stomp that ho, I stomp that ho
When the pressure give in, I just stomp that ho, I stomp that ho
Stomp that ho, I stomp that ho, stomp that ho, I stomp that ho
When the pressure give in, I just stomp that ho, I stomp that ho
Girls don't like boys, girls like cars and money
Boys will laugh at girls when they're not funny
And these girls like these boys, these boys like these girls
The girls with the bodies, the boys with full offers
Girls don't like boys, girls like cars and money
