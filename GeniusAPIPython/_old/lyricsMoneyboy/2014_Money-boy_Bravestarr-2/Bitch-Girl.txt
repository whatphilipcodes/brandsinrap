Shawty wanna leave with a nigga, I bet
'Cause she wanna be on TV with a nigga, I bet
Bet you never thought that she would cheat on you, nigga, I bet
Don't be mad at me, I pull that chopper out and squeeze on you niggas
No sympathy for you niggas

Ho, shut the fuck up, miss me with the bullshit
Ballin' like a bitch, all my niggas hood rich
Bring some bitches to the crib, show 'em what the wood is
Your bitch look like Sheneneh, uh-uh, oh my goodness
It's 500, that be the block
Then you see that ghetto bird when you hear the shots
Where the plug at? Tell him meet me at the docks
Sent the little homie through, it might be the cops
Hol' up, I'm gettin' money, boy
Your girl want me 'cause I got them toys
'Raris and the Bentleys and Aventadors
Double-decker buses and them private jets, I spend it on
Painted on the Maserati, look like it been shitted on
Make her lift her skirt up, if she nervous, I'm a pervert
I be in that pussy deep, a nigga fuckin' up her cervix
Leave the condoms on the bed, man, I do that shit on purpose
'Cause I hope a nigga see it when he comin' home from work

Rolls gas, Royce pedal, pockets on roseo
R-Rosetta, my stones ain't meant for the home, bitch
So comfortable, now get your ass off my couch, bitch
Bounce shit, mouse shit, put in your mouth shit
I've been playin' with the pussy, time to put that thing in
Bang it, I'm bangin', my binger off safety

After the strokin', I be nuttin' in her mouth like this
And you come home like, "Honey, I'm home, come and give me kiss" (Haha)
It's not a thing for me, really not a thing for me
We from different sets, why your bitch wanna bang with me?
All the time, all the time, I be on the grind
