Uh, GG, GGG
1Hunnid, man
I keep it a hunnid, unlike these cap rappin' ass niggas
How you a shooter? You don't got a gun
Rap about bodies, you don't got one
Bro livin' lavish, even on the run
Don't got a bag, better get you one
Huh? No funds, better get you some
No funds, better get you some, huh?

How you a shooter? You don't got a gun (How?)
Rap about bodies, you don't got one (No)
All you cap rappers my sons (Sons)
Bro livin' lavish, even on the run
Don't got a bag, better get you one (Better)
Hit the trap, I was low on the funds (No money)
Don't call me, I ain't tryna have fun (Not)
Don't try me, nigga, I ain't the one (Not)
All this smoke, it could puncture your lungs
Don't compete where you cannot compare
Bro caught two bodies, I call it a pair
Might catch another, lil' nigga, no stairs
All these wops in and out of the stairs
Trap in the hood, and I call it a lair
Gotta win so I ain't playin' it fair
I'm playin' for keeps
Brand new Glizz', and I got it for cheap
Headshots, I ain't aimin' for feet
Bloody scene, I got blood on my sneak's (Bloody)
He's a opp, so I did it for free
Did it for me, did it for gang (Gang)
Don't got a body, then you cannot hang (Can't)
Lost some bro's, a lotta shit done change (Long live the guys)
Heart cold, how can I be the same?
See clear with these Cartier frames
You not like us, we not the same (We're not)
Pitchin' in, tryna get you some weed (Broke)
You pitchin' in, tryna get 10 keys (Birdies)
Plug front, and next time, yeah, ease
'Cause we keep bringing the money so neat (So neat)
Next time, stain gang for free (Stain gang)
Run it back, find me in the streets
I'm in the Jungle with lions and apes
Try to run up, you get hit in the face
Free Flippa, they got bro on a case (Free Flip')
Free 5, they made bro do the race (Free Pedro)
Free Icey, brodie lock off your range
Free Jaylany, been too long in the cage (Free J Man)
Beef with us, you could never be safe
Check the news, we left your block yellow tape
How you a shooter? You don't got a gun (How?)
Rap about bodies, you don't got one (No)
All you cap rappers my sons (Sons)
Bro livin' lavish, even on the run
Don't got a bag, better get you one (Better)
Hit the trap, I was low on the funds (Low-low)
Don't call me, I ain't tryna have fun (Not)
Don't try me, nigga, I ain't the one

Young nigga, bitch, I'm the plug
Hit me up, I can get what you want
Big dawg, got my stick in the club
I cannot leave, call your boss
You couldn't see the shit that I done
Nights on repeat, you spinnin' for once
You tryna please me, go get you one
That boy dreamin', nigga's my son, yeah
Woke up in Ibiza, he in a blunt, yeah
Up on the block, I done made me a hunnid, yeah
Fast lane, better know what it come with, yeah
