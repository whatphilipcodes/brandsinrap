And what's a King to a J Tatum
Ain’t seen what I done seen, don't tell them that you made him
It's either love or the lust, that’s the ultimatum
They drag her name through the mud, I bring home the bacon
And what's a King to a J Tatum
Ain't seen what I done seen, don't tell them that you made him
It's either love or the lust, that's the ultimatum
They drag her name through the mud, I bring home the bacon
Uh huh
Uh and we back
Uh uh, and we back
And we back, and we back
Uh, and we back

Uh, and what's a King to a J Tatum
Ain't seen what I done seen, don’t tell them that you made him
It’s either love or the lust, that's the ultimatum
They drag her name through the mud, I bring home the bacon
And when she yell for God, that’s when I awaken
She wine when she off the wine, it make her feel Jamaican
Everyday we getting better, not today Satan
Ivy League mental, still ballin', Bryce Aiken
These niggas average, you can have em, we are not basic
Sound mind, sound body, this is not Asics
Different niggas in the mirror and I had to face it
She said I had a big ego, told her to embrace it
And now I'm ballin' off the rebound
Two o’clock in the morning, going onto three now
She ain't cheap, she love the Jeep, she told me put the seat down
Deuces to your favorite rapper, it is me now
And if I did it, I swear it ain't my last
Got 'em thinking they're in first, they're behind me like my past
And she know that I got her, she ain't even got to ask
If it's on 'bout my brothers, they ain't even got to ask
Too sick, and I don't want to heal myself
All that hate trynna numb me, I can feel myself
See the realest in the mirror, keep it real with myself
Only God can take a King, want me to kill myself
Too sick, and I don't want to heal myself
All that hate trynna numb me, I can feel myself
See the realest in the mirror, keep it real with myself
Only God can take a King, want me to kill myself (uh)

Uh, in for the win, I won't pick to lose
Now I get what I want, I used to have to pick and choose
See the way we living now, don't you get the shit confused
I first knew happiness when I could choose different shoes
I'm just a rapper but to her I'm not these other dudes
Give her what she want and dip, just to keep me out the blues
Grew up seeing momma cry, I just want to change her views
End up anywhere but the top, nigga I refuse
Back when Wayne was on Hustler Musik
When Em used to rap about how'd he lose it
Only fear back them was my momma getting shot
Only goal right now is to make it to the top
If you hate, take a shot
Money Mitch, drop top
Man I want this shit forever, I ain't ever gon' stop
And I'm here with the same niggas from Ronto block
After this, I'm the talk of every barbershop, you know
And if I did it, I swear it ain't my last
Got 'em thinking they're in first, they're behind me like my past
And she know that I got her, she ain't even got to ask
If it's on 'bout my brothers, they ain't even got to ask
Too sick, and I don't want to heal myself
All that hate trynna numb me, I can feel myself
See the realest in the mirror, keep it real with myself
Only God can take a King, want me to kill myself
Too sick, and I don't want to heal myself
All that hate trynna numb me, I can feel myself
See the realest in the mirror, keep it real with myself
Only God can take a King, want me to kill myself (uh)

The pain of chasing girls and money, boy I been through it
A couple hundreds in the club, boy I been threw it
To keep it real, a couple hundred ain't a lot
With no money, showed me love, what's her name? well I forgot
Uh, and she don't judge me, she know that I'm forever faded
And I can't love her just because the type of girls I dated
And if I ask 'em right now, they'd be down to fuck
But if you ask them all tomorrow, I'm the one they hated
Ask her how she doin', hit me with that same line
I replied, "yes you are" cause she said "fine"
And I bet I'll be on top after one line
Just like this rap shit, I'll be there for a long time
Ask me how I get it, I'm a hustler baby
New King to this shit, no if's and maybe's
I done had to eat shit, seen shit just to pay my dues
So with all due respect, nigga fuck you pay me
Uh huh
Yeah
And we back
Uh Uh
And we back
And we back
And we back
And we back

And if I did it, I swear it ain't my last
Got 'em thinking they're in first, they're behind me like my past
And she know that I got her, she ain't even got to ask
If it's on 'bout my brothers, they ain't even got to ask
Too sick, and I don't want to heal myself
All that hate trynna numb me, I can feel myself
See the realest in the mirror, keep it real with myself
Only God can take a King, want me to kill myself
Too sick, and I don't want to heal myself
All that hate trynna numb me, I can feel myself
See the realest in the mirror, keep it real with myself
Only God can take a King, want me to kill myself (uh)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
