Uh, mind ya' bidness bitch, get out the way
That nigga eating like 'God is great,' I gotta say
They watered down, boy I pull the flowers out the vase
You either frowning at life or smiling at ya' wake
Okay, big-face hundreds I'm thinking Tyra Banks
Moving dust for the bread, who ordered powdered cake?
She say meet me at the altar wait, you gotta change
She tryna show me the light, we share a common pain
Uh, you love me but baby what would you do for love?
Flow tight as a groupie hug, you knew what's up
This is paradise, I live a weird life
I want my style back, 'cause they don't wear it right
This 40 cal with me, I'm on a dairy diet
A diamond in the rough, I went to Jared right?
Throwing bodies in trunks, no they ain't sparing life
Man these niggas too pussy, they like a pair of dykes
Yikes, bumping Anita Baker
Slumped in my seat while she doming me and proceed to taste it
My nigga hit me 'bout a lick I told him keep it tasteful
And they was blunt wit' a nigga but now they need the vapors
I got the feature from Khaled, shit I'm forever grateful
I'm in the ghetto like 'nana pudding vanilla wafers
I'm from the ghetto where every day is like Revelations
I represent for them niggas dreaming that never made it
Ayo they saying we got next 'do, go tell the neighbors
Peep how I chef this shit up, baby go  the table
They did us dirty we paid 'em back, that's reparations
Nigga I'm speeding through life, this shit is Talladega
Check the scoreboard player, we running up this paper
Boy been a blow-out, I feel like Angie Davis
Wings on the coupe, flames on the spoon
All these new niggas looking like fiends on the news
I'm quick to spot a opp like a stain on a suit
My life is under construction like trees on the boot
Ay I'm the truth nigga, this is audio Mona Lisa
I burn this shit like cardio, promise you I'ma freak her
I kidnapped ya' princess Mario, hide ya' diva
Kicking shit around these parts they robbing ya' for ya' sneakers
Every line is murder, shit how is this not illegal?
Going dead on you fucks, she fondle me while I'm sleeping
Shit, I'm off the deep end, uh, no I don't seek trends
'Cause all that shit that you talking 'bout is beneath him
Uh, well alright, bumping that Stevie Wonder
People take heed my hunger, the illest in this genre
Ain't talking back to momma, but ain't no need to mumble
Ain't acting out in church, but still I keep the thumper
Only one take in life, just know I weave the punches
Okay I want the numbers, but I don't need the numbers
I keep it funky with my circle like I'm eating Funyuns
Leave the jungle just to come back to feed the jungle
Okay, time to get this money boy I gotta get paid
I respect all you niggas but I'm in line with the greats
I cop the drop sitting crooked, like Denzel with the fade
And took the shoes off that shit like Fantasia on stage
Yeah back in this bitch, with my car keys nigga
It's the trill OG, but ain't no part three nigga
You know them boys on the corner, like a chop cheese nigga
If I'm riding a bitch, I'm at the park feeding pigeons
Need a piece of the pie, this shit fresh out the kitchen
Got a question for niggas, did y'all know I'd deliver?
On everything that I love, I gotta post on my Pinterest
Man the world is so twisted they out here blaming the victim
I put no babies on albums, too much pain in my pictures
Just left tour with Godson, he gave me game and some wisdom
Crooked cop crooked cop, all these babies y'all killing
Gotta bear arms, don't wanna catch a stray from a piglet
I done seen it all, continue being blessed
I play above the rim, it's in my genes Shep
Confidence on a billion, never see me in debt
I got this shit sewed, y'all niggas seem stress
Change the game young nigga, don't let it change you
I keep the nina wit' me, turn niggas to strange fruit
I'm not a gangster just cautious of what this fame do
These niggas talking sideways like they playing flute
Presidential Rollie, usual politics
Pussy and compliments, matching designers' wits
Issues with momma's men, youngest of momma's kids
Even my father died before we could squash the shit
Carolina's prince, where should I begin?
All these scrambled thoughts, I need a side of grits
It's all about ya' drive, and not the size of rim
I'm calling niggas out, let's get 'em conferenced in
I never had nothing, I was a sad something
But now they tryna ride the wave I got the bath bubbling
No I don't need the hype I speak up on my people's plight
I'm branching out, chilling up under the tree of life
They throwing shade my nigga, it happens for a reason
'Cause all the cars got paper plates and everybody's eating
We out here making movies, I'm 'bout to drop the teaser
Diarrhea flow I make the shit look too easy
