Stepped in the strip with a strap like a militant
Brown and peng big back got melanin
Love them zoot, them fat like elephant
Who's that yout, swear down irrelevant
Gave gal D, not on about vitamin
Big ting that touch man like skeleton
War with the bros you're not intelligent
When bros on your block be vigilant
(Ai)
Stepped in like what's happening
Want war? I'll bring action
Like skududu it's a madting
You're on me like imagine
If you're on bro then I'm backing
Them chatty man, they're just acting
The clips out and i'll cast them
I'm comfy I'm relaxing

Two shots leave a man tipsy
Bare hard work I don’t mind like Risky
They make no moves like they're mannequins
Bring force to the war like I'm anakin
44 come long like a javelin
Panicking panicking panicking
Went to the strip with a mash in my whip, still get kissed with my fist like a mistletoe
Took mans chick and he didn't know
Man do mash do trap with bro
(Aye)
Roley on me always gliding
Stoney on me I'm designing
See a pengin then I slide in
Put in work, I put my time in
Niggas on me but they're trying
Said they're on me but they're lying

One shot, two shots or dippings
Watch corn fly by civilians
