We be big tippin', spendin' green
In the hood, gettin' money, boy I got what you need
Ha!  We hot, you cold
That ice?  On froze
That six?  On chrome
Them bricks? They gone!
Copped the Cris cases, my watch got the big faces
Leanin' like a thug in the club throwin' big faces
This for them dope boys, chopper in the trunk boys
Welcome to my hood hood, home of the dope boys!

That's the fire?  Drop that low
That's the prime?  Let that blow
That's the nine?  Let that go
That's the time?  I let that show
Shinin' bright, check the price
If that's the ice, let that snow
Servin' hard, servin' soft
If that's the white, boy, let that snow!
One to spit, I'm a pimp
Eatin' shrimp up at Joe's
In the six, roll with tints
Gettin' bent, choppin O's

I'll make your mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
Guns so long they reach to South Beach
Live from the curb where birds is dirt cheap
You don't shine?  I don't shine
If we don't grind, we don't eat
We the truth in the South, it's about to go down
Carbon 15 with the beam hold 30 rounds
645 ridin' by with the trunk loud
Welcome to my hood hood, bet you niggas know now!
