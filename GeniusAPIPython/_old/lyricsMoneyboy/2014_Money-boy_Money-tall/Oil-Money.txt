[Chorus}
Brown Skin
Brown Cash
Brown Kings
Brown Ass (Yeah, yeah!)
Brown Boy
Brown Honey
Brown Queens
Brown Money (Yeah, cha-ching!)
Brown Skin
Brown Cash
Brown Kings
Brown Ass (Yeah, yeah!)
Brown Boy
Brown Honey
Brown Queens
Brown Money (Yeah, yeah!)

Yung Sultan
Skrr skrr skrr in the whip with a mouthful of paan (chayze)
Raising the bar like my name is khan
Not a terrorist cos I rep Islam
Spice up the Kush with the Haldi
My bars influential like It's Vivaldi
Pull up in auto's then leave in an Audi
So many Dirhams you'd think I’m from Saudi
Wait
Ha!

Fuck that oil money BOY (Yeah!)
Been poor rich living BOY (Yeah!)
Rob the country that robbed me
Fuck sob stories, I never sobbed see, so stop G
Allow me
I’m Brown life livin
Slumboy
Wanna be tour life chilling
Put my Woman in some Sabyasachi (Chayze!)
Play my tunes from Colombo to Karachi
My bars for the yutes in the trackies and Huaraches (Gang, gang!)
And the Brown Queens in Versace (Chayze!)
Cook up the flames like the Chachis
And just like Itachi
I do what I gotta do, go where I go
Kill the whole game, Family, Friend or Foe
And so
Lemme take back my soul (What?)
I said lemme take back my soul (What?)
I said
LEMME TAKE BACK MY SOUL
I'm in my element when I be rhyming
I'll be taking back my Kohinoor Diamond
Lungi and Kurtha on catwalks, I swear I be styling
Man
Man I be wildin'
Cocky lil' shit call me Prince Naseem
BOB - WEAVE - KNOCKOUT, then I kiss my teeth
Heart on sleeve
People may preconceive
And undermine
But I'll be fine
Cos why??
[Chorus}
Brown Skin

Brown Kings
Brown Ass (Yeah, yeah!)
Brown Boy
Brown Honey
Brown Queens
Brown Money (Yeah, cha-ching!)
Brown Skin
Brown Cash
Brown Kings
Brown Ass (Yeah, skrr!)
Brown Boy
Brown Honey
Brown Queens
Brown Money (Cha-ching, cha-ching!)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
