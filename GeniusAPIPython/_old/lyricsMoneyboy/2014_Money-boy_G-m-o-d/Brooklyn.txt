I reign supreme in this bitch, I reign supreme in this bitch
Just me and my team in this bitch, me and my team in this bitch
Boy I'm a god in my city, boy I'm a god in my city
And I keep a mob of them with me, I keep a mob of them with me
I reign supreme in this bitch, I reign supreme in this bitch
Just me and my team in this bitch, me and my team in this bitch
Boy I'm a god in my city, boy I'm a god in my city
And I keep a mob of them with me, I keep a mob of them with me

I done came up, got my name up
People saying I changed up
Cause it's hard to pick my chain up
I done came up, got my name up
People saying I changed up
Cause I'm in a whole new lane, bruh

I'm seeing your jealousy, I'm seeing your jealousy
You hate that I'm cooking, debating in Brooklyn, they craving my recipes (Whoo)
I'm seeing your jealousy, I'm seeing your jealousy
Somebody tell Oprah, I want that cochocha, If not cut a check for me (Uh)
That shouldn't be a surprise
Just look in my eyes, you'll see I'm outlandish
Fucking a broad that I can't understand
When she screams I'm the man, she says it in Spanish
I got some pockets and wallets that's filled up with faces of niggas I studied in school
Uhh
I got a clique of piranhas, you don't want no drama, don't jump in my pool
I don't give a fuck what you saying
Unless it's 'bout money boy fuck what you saying
I doubt it's a talk that's worth saving
So don't waste your breath nigga
Fuck is you saying?
Nothing, Skrrrrr
Copping exotics of everything popping, I don't give a fuck
None of these niggas sit down at my level, so none of these niggas are hitting my blunt

All that I got is my Mom and my homies
Everyone else likes to think that they know me
Fuck everyone else now I'm back on my Broly
I turned the key to my city to rollies

Uhh, uhh
Raised in the era of Tyson
Get rich or die trying, where bullets were flying
Overseas flying's extremely enticing
Don't know how to act so you know that I'm wiling
Night after night after night after night, bitches getting the pipe off a bottle of Henny
Promoters gon' pay me, no ifs and no maybes
I'm taking it all, boy I want every penny
Uhh
I ain't playing with you
If you playing with my money then I'm aiming at you
Anybody by your body's gon' be laying with you
You're taking us too, or it'll be like taking a two
That's your bae? Well I'm taking her too, while strangling you
Short one, you want to put a flame to my fuse
It'll show that you lack in the brain if you use
Cause it's a different kind of hammer when I'm banging my tools
All of my life I've been dreaming 'bout reigning
Now that I'm gone dollars thrown and it's raining
Flexing on everyone love me like Raymond
Only took them six seconds to learn what the name is
Uhh
