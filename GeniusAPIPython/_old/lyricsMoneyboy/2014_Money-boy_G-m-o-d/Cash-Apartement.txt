Yeah, okay

Got brand new kicks after cousins had rocked 'em
And fresh to death, was really a problem
'Cause where I'm from, if you bring a bat
Them boys gon' light up the sky like it's Gotham
Live fast, get cash, the motto and creed
Roll with the punches, it's government lunches
So they on the block like it's government cheese
We protect names, so let's call him (Hold up, hold up, hold up)
He copped a whip and the dash, it was digital
And he kept makin' cash like residuals
And them chicks was all bad in his livin' room
And he cool, so I ask what he get into
I know he ain't been to the tropics
But he said he'd deal with exotics (That's honest)
And he know that my daddy a deacon
But out here, he really a profit (Got it)
It was crazy the way that his chain glow
Light on my ice like I'm Cano
Had a Mitchell and Ness from the Bengals
The first year, he was Ochocinco
Watching, ticking, time begins
Whatever type of time you on, I needs in
Play it back dawg, I need sâ€” (Hold up)
Nah, throw me a dub, man, I need wins
He ain't believin' my hype, but said "Chav
If you want it, then homie, go get it"
Most dudes think about gettin' money
But honestly, it's all about how you spend it
But then he got jammed on a Rico
Now he spendin' life behind a peephole
And I'm back to ground zero
But I'm fresh in this all-white tee, though
Yeah, I'm fresh, yeah, I'm fresh
Check my style, the way I dress
Swagger jackets, they all cappers
Switch they tassels to the left
Yeah, I'm fresh, oh yes
Fully woke, no rest
In a league of my own
We don't mesh, nonetheless
Yeah, I'm fresh, yeah
They savin' my pictures like it's Pinterest
And they know I'm fire, spark they interest (Yeah)
I know they some checkers, I'm playin' chess (Yeah)
And I ain't even peaked (Yeah)

Back in college, woah
I drove a Cutty and it had a whole lotta mileage
Uh, roaches all in my apartment with me and Jahmari
But I told the homies I'm headed somewhere, I'm a pilot
Plus, the way I was whippin' that cutlass, it looked like a Rari
Can't believe that we made it, it go without sayin'
I bet on myself like it's Vegas
I kept it real, I was never Fugazi
My life is a book, you just hearin' the pages, yeah
I'm tryna motivate all of my bros
We gotta hit all our goals
Convertible Phantom on coast
Dead to that talkin', I'm ghost
Glory, hallelujah (Mm-hmm), God first
'Til my hearse, that's how we movin' (Mm-hmm)
But if we talkin' money, boy, I speak it fluent (Mm-hmm)
Yeah, ayy, a lot of y'all is clueless, let me show you how to do it
Yeah, I'm fresh
Yeah, I'm fresh, yeah, I'm fresh
Check my style, the way I dress
Swagger jackets, they all cappers
Switch they tassels to the left
Yeah, I'm fresh, oh yes
Fully woke, no rest
In a league of my own
We don't mesh, nonetheless
Yeah, I'm fresh, yeah
They savin' my pictures like it's Pinterest
And they know I'm fire, spark they interest
I know they some checkers, I'm playin' chess
And I ain't even peaked

That's it for the people
Fresh
Yeah, yeah, yeahEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
