She love when I'm all in
Smoking on gas like Marley
Your money short, like 4'10"
Clip longer than Slenderman
Mask on my face like a terrorist
Stop acting out, that's embarrassing
I'm too much life, she can't handle it
She pose for a pic like a mannequin
Throwin' bullets like I'm Big Ben
She want me all for herself, no sharin'
Running to that money, boy, you trailin'
Out the country, somewhere alone
Give her the Perc' 10, I know it
So I'ma push up on it
Watch how I kill my opponent

I'm driving the whip like it's stolen
I'm in the field like I'm Tony
They watching me like I'm Sony
Tattoos on my face like an essay
Got Dracos and Glocks and AKs
Clip so big, we got five eights
She wanna come and kickback Friday
Now she throwing up off the Bombay
Tell her bend over, she like okay
I make her wet just like a hurricane
Diamonds, they dancin', they going insane
Big rockstar, ice in my veins
They love me, this my campaign
Championship, we pop champagne
Gun black as fuck, Luol Deng
She love when I'm all in
Smoking on gas like Marley
Your money short, like 4'10"
Clip longer than Slenderman
Mask on my face like a terrorist
Stop acting out, that's embarrassing
I'm too much life, she can't handle it
She pose for a pic like a mannequin
Throwin' bullets like I'm Big Ben
She want me all for herself, no sharin'
Running to that money, boy, you trailin'
Out the country, somewhere alone
Give her the Perc' 10, I know it
So I'ma push up on it
Watch how I kill my opponent

I just spent twenty-five-hundred on jeans
I don't wanna fuck her, she calling me mean
Slide down with the K, it kill the whole scene
I pop a Perc' and now I'm rolling
Drive the Lambo like it's stolen
Yeah, you know I stole it
She said lil' baby you so lit
I got a .223 for my opponent
I'm tryna shoot at the opps, slide down on your block, ha, ha
We get bloody, you know we shot ya, yeah
You claim you a shooter then put your Glock up
It got the thirty clip, that bitch filled up
I'm tryna shoot a nigga from his neck up
She off the coke, can't handle it
Kick her out the spot, I'm scandalous
She don't know how hell feels
I bet he don't know how jail feels
I'm with K Suave, we out in the hills
I'm up in Saks, I'ma buy her some heels
Pull on my block, we gon' shoot out your wheels
I'm screaming out slatt, I'm a slime for real
She love when I'm all in
Smoking on gas like Marley
Your money short, like 4'10"
Clip longer than Slenderman
Mask on my face like a terrorist
Stop acting out, that's embarrassing
I'm too much life, she can't handle it
She pose for a pic like a mannequin
Throwin' bullets like I'm Big Ben
She want me all for herself, no sharin'
Running to that money, boy, you trailin'
Out the country, somewhere alone
Give her the Perc' 10, I know it
So I'ma push up on it
Watch how I kill my opponentEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
