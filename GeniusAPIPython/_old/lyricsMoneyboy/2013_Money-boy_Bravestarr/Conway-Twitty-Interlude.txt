I see the sparkling little diamond on your hand
It's plain to see that you've already got a man
I can tell you're not about to fall for any of my lies
I see the want to in your eyes

Deep in your smile there's a quiet, soft desire
Like the embers of a once raging fire
You know I could light that fire again, you know it isn't wise
I see the want to in your eyes

How strong's a band of gold
Is it strong enough to hold
When a love has grown cold
And A woman wants a love, sweet and warm

How many women just like you have silent schemes?
How many men like me do they sleep with in their dreams?
You can stay or you can go and although I sympathize
I still see the want to in your eyes
