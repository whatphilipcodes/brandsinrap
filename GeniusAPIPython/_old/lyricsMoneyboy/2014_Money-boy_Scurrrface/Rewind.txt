Woah, Lord, shawty, just shut the fuck up
(30, you a motherfucking fool, nigga)
But I'm still gon' pay you no attention
Gotta let you see this pussy, you gon' miss it
I know you hear me on the radio
I know I'm better than your other hoes
But I'm still gon' pay you no attention
Gotta let you see this pussy, you gon' miss it

He a slut, he a ho, he a freak
Got a different broad every day of the week, uh
Mama said real men don't cheat
So how about you, her and me for the three? Uh
Lace on fleek, flash last week
No scratch, no weave, no track, no meet
Just facts, no cap, uh, no, sirree
All black Vs, back to back like Meek

I know you hear me on the radio (True)
I know I'm better than your other hoes (True)
But I'm still gon' pay you no attention (Hey)
Gotta let you see this pussy, you gon' miss it (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I know you hear me on the radio (Hey, hey, hey, true)
I know I'm better than your other hoes (True)
But I'm still gon' pay you no attention
Gotta let you see this pussy, you gon' miss it
My DJ, shawty, don't scratch
Bitches gon' hate, shawty gon' scrap
One more time for the hustlers in the back
Reel up, rewind, bring the whole thing back
Tracks don't fade like my name tat
Where the thing at? Where the—where the thing at?
Fi-fi-fight break out like "Where we hang at?"
Where the thing at? Where the—where the thing at?
Right

I know you hear me on the radio (True)
I know I'm better than your other hoes (True)
But I'm still gon' pay you no attention (Hey)

I know you hear me on the radio (Hey, hey, hey, true)
I know I'm better than your other hoes (True)
But I'm still gon' pay you no attention
Gotta let you see this pussy, you gon' miss it

Woah, Lord, shawty, just shut the fuck up
Gettin' money, gettin' money, gettin' money, boy
Gettin' money, gettin' money, gettin' money, boy (Bring it back)
Money, money
