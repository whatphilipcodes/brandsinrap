We high in the corruption index
We ah small island, ah mad (stress) and ah been vex
Coming like ah super soldier when dey inject
Serum in de veins super saiyan when de ting flex
Ah going to grip the mic straight till death
Bitter like a man in debt but he still (stress) fete
Government get we trust and dey milk it
White collar crime and you cyah make a jail yet

Ah going to make a jail with this one
Ah getting no bail cause ah snipe from a distance
Mih aim doh fail ten shots never miss once
And ah gone in ah instance
Rapso flow no biggie or kane
No indicator swerve in Lancelot Layne
Straight innovator men say daz no sane
When yuh see me later flood in Port of Spain

Granny used to say doh follow nobody
Used to eat green plum cause de yellow too runny
Now mih belly not yellow ah doh fraid nobody
Know who ah ha to be, ah talking bout holly
Dragon breathing fire you are more unsullied
We are trini tell me weed how you go pop molly
Future crab let we breathe how you go stop money
Boy you in a dollar jam and the deejay call mummy
Killing on de beat but ah so angelic
You doh wanna try me ah go give you headache
Trinis like salt we is so embedded
Never going to stop like a troll going on reddit
And we going up growing up now you see we glowing up
Now we getting big now ah few friends showing up
Ah doh need dem, read books now ah know enough

Trini's like salt we's...rapso flow no
Trini's like salt we's million dollar jam
Killing on de beat we's so angelic
You doh wnna try me ah go give you headache
(x2)

Yuh really wah mess with the hardest working
Far from certain
Ah grind till mih abs are hurting
Mark mih turf, big shark and yuh passing surfin
Get yuh style put down like bags ah curtain
Trini to de world men was smirking change tune
But dey copy it far from perfect dey doom
Is imminent to break it down as say soon
I bringing it tell de radio make room
This a south boy ting ha to represent
Do the rapso ting, I in mih element
Throw a militant tweet and a at a fan
We is kindred peeps going at a klan
No label ah give mihself an advance
Turn tables dey say ah never stand ah chance
Dey eh able, de love spread hand to hand
No fable, survey saying iz de man

Tell yuh iz de man when i do my ting
Steady getting fans every tune I bring
Now we on de top allyuh watching we0
Allyuh too bad mind just stop it please

Lewwe do de ting we starting off now
Two puncheon shot and you parking up now
We done buy a half you have enough now?
And yuh girl did pass to raj you up now
Just pace on beat ah starring up now
Is face on yuh beat you large enough now
Any fete on de street we having up town
Too much men does storm when we have it down south
Trini's like salt we's...rapso flow no
Trini's like salt we's million dollar jam
Killing on de beat we's so angelic
You doh wnna try me ah go give you headache
