Every day is Halloween
Every day is Halloween

Buh, I'm behind you, run for your life
I'm behind you with a gun and a knife
Bitch, I'm a beast and I'm hungry tonight
You bring a knife, I bring a gun to the fight
Bitch, I'm a monster, every day is halloween
I'm a monster, every night is halloween
Bitch, I'm a monster, every day is halloween
I'm a monster, every night is halloween

I'm a vampire, call me Dracula (Muha, ha, ha)
Bitch, I go for your neck, I'm the 
I go dumb, I go ham, I go brain-dead
I go completely retarded, brain man
No brain in my head, I'm a no-brainer
On the corner all day, like a 
I blow your brains and call it a blowjob
I shave my head and I grow me a mohawk
I'm a monster, every day is halloween
And I make cake, you call me Sara Lee
Guap, I got that Pillsbury dough, boy
But I will kill you for your dough, boy
I got guns in my house, low corridor
Dead corpse on the floor, call the coroner
I just killed your mom and dad in the living room
Now they both lying dead in the living room
Buh, I'm behind you, run for your life
I'm behind you with a gun and a knife
Bitch, I'm a beast and I'm hungry tonight
You bring a knife, I bring a gun to the fight
Bitch, I'm a monster, every day is halloween
I'm a monster, every night is halloween
Bitch, I'm a monster, every day is halloween
I'm a monster, every night is halloween

Call me Jack the Ripper, call me Michael Myers
I'll do tricks with a Swiss knife like MacGyver (Slash!)
Get your melon split, get your pumpkin smashed
I'll have you murked by a Blood in a zombie mask
All about my gold, I'm the Leprachaun in the hood
And I got them  like a restaurant in the hood
Dope game easy, the rap game is child's play
My name is Jason and today it's a Friday
I'm right behind you, so you better flee fast
I got my tens on and a fucking Scream mask
They said "ordinary", this is sorta scary
I slice you up and serve your meat in my corner 
That's a lotta meat, where the pickle at?
I set your fucking crib on fire with a cigarette
With a cigarette and some propane
Watch it burn and slump to ashes like cocaine
Buh, I'm behind you, run for your life
I'm behind you with a gun and a knife
Bitch, I'm a beast and I'm hungry tonight
You bring a knife, I bring a gun to the fight
Bitch, I'm a monster, every day is halloween
I'm a monster, every night is halloweenEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
