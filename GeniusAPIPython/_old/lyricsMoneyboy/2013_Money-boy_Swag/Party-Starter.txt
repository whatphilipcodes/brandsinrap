{Verse 1}
I'm from Lil rock not Lil Raq got a big Glock with a big mac
We got big chops with 100 shots so any opp can get whacked
Every time a nigga Tweet beef it go to Instagram then it get leaked
Money is numbers and numbers don't end so my life a never be complete
Southside and Southend When I'm with my niggas it ain't safe
Niggas love to fight but they pull tools, you get caught slippin shot in the face
You Lil niggas I'm ill nigga, When it comes to shooting we kill niggas
Lil Dyl nigga want mills nigga, Got more Tommy's than Hilfiger
It's a difference between me and you, Things you rap about nigga Yeen' do
Tryna Get money get off the block cause I wanna see my family make it threw
You is not a Hitta, You are not savage, Goofy nigga you not loud to me
If y'all niggas knew my struggle I swear y'all a be so proud of me
Since a Younging y'all been duckin', Walking threw the fields when y'all niggas wasn't
On the block with my young niggas it a get to bussin' with no discussion
Block Burna call lil braxton, Him and aj gone make it happen
It's no lackin', it's Money Gang, and you broke niggas ain't with the faction
Shout out FTS, That's who I do it for, man all my niggas be getting bread
If I don't answer phone calls I'm either getting money or I'm getting head
We got bandannas, I go bananas, I promote the work like OG Montana
Got a white savanna, Name Dirty Diana, In Alabama selling Indiana
In the league but I don't even play shoot em up like Rudy Gay
If you not reaching for the top then goofy opp that's the wrong way
Will you must be smoking Will, Tryna beef with us boy you better chill
We got Mac 11s, We got Mac 10s, for any nigaa that wanna' feel
DC no Washington he done took the trip to OC
Will mane you like 17 goofy nigga you don't know me
I'm a young nigga posted on the block, niggas yo age won't come on
Young rich nigga, no Migos, all I want is comma's like a run on
Shout out my nigga Zay, yeah the real one, Gotta Lot of guns wanna feel one
Catching bodies like a wide receiver, And these lame niggas ain't killed one
Don't build houses but we move bricks, it ain't yo birthday but you gettin' licks
Don't gotta say her name but I know you remember When yo first cousin had sent me pics
{Verse 2}
Real niggas what up, Ain't getting money shut up
It's lil rock and you won't survive if you ain't about them bucks
Dart gang man y'all niggas goofies y'all niggas actors can't get in movies
Yall niggas groupies, Album worldwide the whole world a buy it like a sonic smoothie
Where you niggas from claiming Southend call them davis boys watch ya mouth then
His momma told em he couldn't go to a party and this lame nigga started pouting
The 40 start bussing, the hospital rushing, The momma ask will who is the suspect
I went to Horse? Man but I didn't pay attention the money is my only subject
Check the resume, Check the background, check my old schools, check the new ones
Ask any nigga that saw me fight boy they a tell you who won
Ain't getting money then stop, I'm posted up on these blocks
Not on now but when I get on I'm still Arkansas Little Rock
I dont hang with these rappers, I mostly hang with my trappers
Catch lil zay I beat his face my young niggas kidnappers
She heard bout King dyl now she blushin
My niggas blitz deep we rushin
Bring another world war no russia
Keep My army with No Usher
You ain't getting money boy you a sucker
Got a lot of birds I'm a plucker
I'll Send bricks straight town on rush hour Chris Tucker
Heard a nigga from the dale than got his shoes snatched
Tried to take his nigga Zi to get his shoes back1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
