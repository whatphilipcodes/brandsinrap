Gang
I gave this lil hoe my number now she can't stop usin' it
I just bought a new chopper now I can't stop usin' it
Made in Italy, my shoes got 2 Gs on em
Cop a foreign than I threw some D's on em
Im a dog on every beat I leave fleas on em
See my pistol like a lemon boy dont make me squeeze on ya
And bitch if you ain't no stripper I ain't throwin cheese on you
Im so cold I might leave you froze if I sneeze on you
If you do blow then bring me yo nose
Out here sellin blow
Ran out of baggage so I told my hoes to go to the store
Chopper left him with a bald head, but he had a fro
They wanted smoke now they all dead
Go look at the score
The hottest nigga in it, ain't I?
Baby Im a big dog but I ain't a K9
You droppin names to the feds? Boy you better not say non'
Get 200 for the time bitch can't let her waste mine
The cops tried to get it back at me
Tough luck damned if they pull me over with this shit in my trunk
Fast whip with the pink slip, bitch this my shit
Im ridin in it with a full clip of this hot shit
Ridin 26's on the road to riches. Bitches blow me kisses
Tried to tell em but they didn't listen now they reminiscin'
Cause they dissin, I bought ammunition for the opposition
You ain't got no vision and you confused with no intuition
This bitch so thick she can't even fit her thong
I can't consider pistol cause the clip is too long
She can't inhale her smoke cause the reefa too strong
I know I was gon' make it. Won't be broke for too long
Bitch I got my shoes I rock Christian Luves when I walk
Money in my room I dont got no room in the vault
If you make the news fuckin' with my dudes thats your fault
Tried to run he fell, should've tied his shoes before he walked
I Gave that bitch my number
Even though I knew she would stalk
He say he the truth even when I knew he was false
Actin like he hard even though I knew he was soft
I was sellin hard I know what to do with the soft
Bitch Im livin large like Im Big Pun in this bitch
Like some morphine, leave a nigga numb in this bitch
Big booty bitch, I might put my thumb in her shit
Switched ruger clips and I put a drum on that bitch
Bitch Im trynna put my paws on a bag like im Santa Clause
Get all in her jaws, kick her out, and forget to call
Nigga im a bear, you a dog. Got a different claw
Nigga you ain't seen what I saw boy my vision raw
Ridin 4 deep with that heat no drive out
We walk up, leave a nigga block chalked up
You kill one of mine we get our lick back, we need to sober up
I put my drop top in a paint shop, it need a close up
This bitch lookin at me like wine she fine as hell
She wanna fuck my watch well only time will tell
You broke as hell, in that cell, you can't make your bail
We got pounds, we got bails, and they all for sale
Sixes on my cutlass got me sittin' tall as hell
A nigga press my buttons then you know we raisin hell
You wanna have my baby hoe you must be crazy as hell
Get up and get some money boy yo' ass lazy as hell
Ran up a quarter mill and I ain't even got no deal
I rode with the steel and I dont even need no pill
You actin like you drill, you ain't even in no field
Even though Im grown still ridin on big wheels
