Shorty from the west side and she wanna party (She)
Looking for some love cos she a little thirsty
Getting faded real bad with that drank and charly (Coca)
End up high on pills if she ain’t got no money
Boy her friends real tight and they boss ass ladies (Damn man)
Workaholics driving in their own Mercedes (Yah)
They ain’t got no time for your bs homie (Nah nah)
Better get your game straight or you’ll end up lonely (Peace)

Twerking on that, and they don’t plan to stop
Bouncing on ya, they wanna make you pop (Uh huh)
Mess with your head, until you’re dead and gone
Spend all your cash, but you ain’t gettin none
Shorty bumping’ grinding’ as a foreplay
She asks me for a tip i tell her no way
Takes me to this dark end of the hallway
She asks me for the time i tell her (Yah)

It’s my birthday (Yeah), it’s my birthday (Wow)
It’s my birthday (Yeah), it’s my birthday yeah
It’s my birthday, it’s my birthday (Sku)
It’s my birthday, it’s my birthday (Yeah)
It’s my birthday (Yeah), it’s my birthday (Yah)
It’s my birthday (straight up), it’s my birthday yeah
It’s my birthday (Cheesh), it’s my birthday (Wow)
It’s my birthday, it’s my birthday
Dollar bills and champagne ain’t enough for you (She)
Only knows the lavish life what’s wrong with you (Yeah)
Ignoring all the other dudes she talking too
She wants something new, girl no
Cos she knows, she knows, she knows
She might not live another tomorrow
There she goes, she goes, she goes
Look at her numbing all her pain and she wants more

Twerking on that, and they don’t plan to stop
Bouncing on ya, they wanna make you pop (Uh huh)
Mess with your head, until you’re dead and gone
Spend all your cash, but you ain’t gettin none
Shorty bumping’ grinding’ as a foreplay
She asks me for a tip i tell her no way
Takes me to this dark end of the hallway
She asks me for the time i tell her (Yah)

It’s my birthday (Yeah), it’s my birthday (Wow)
It’s my birthday (Yeah), it’s my birthday yeah
It’s my birthday, it’s my birthday (Sku)
It’s my birthday, it’s my birthday (Yeah)
It’s my birthday (Yeah), it’s my birthday (Yah)
It’s my birthday (straight up), it’s my birthday yeah
It’s my birthday (Cheesh), it’s my birthday (Wow)
It’s my birthday, it’s my birthdayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
