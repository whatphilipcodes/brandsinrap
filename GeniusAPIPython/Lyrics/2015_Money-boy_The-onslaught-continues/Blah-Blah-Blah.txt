So if one fight, then we all fight
And I'm on go with no green light
Nigga, free DK, shout out my slatt
I'm feelin' like Autumn!, the toolie go blatt!
Juugin' that boy, now he whine and he beg
That ho buss it down, she givin' me neck
Blatt, blatt, go
I'ma draw down, never let up (Nah-nah, nah-nah)
(Mom, Polack's making beats again)

Tell that lil' boy to catch up, I'ma draw down, never let up (Blatt)
Run a check up, grab my weapon, man I'm feelin' like this is a setup
And I feel like it's gon' be a bloody day today (Blatt, blatt)
Yeah, yeah, we never worried at the end of the day (Yeah)
Bitch spending racks on that nigga head, he dead (Blatt)
I done came in with the gang, and he scared (Skrr)
Test me, hope you ready to die
My gun a thot, it be aiming for head
Chop chop like a nigga a chef
Say lil' Faygo don't need nobody else
I done came in with a hard 9, yeah that ho shine with some headlights
Buh-buh-buh, bye, he a dead guy
Call the gang up like it's mob ties
So if one fight, then we all fight
And I'm on go with no green light
Nigga, free DK, shout out my slatt
I'm feelin' like Autumn!, the toolie go blatt!
Juugin' that boy, now he whine and he beg
That ho buss it down, she givin' me neck
And when I come through, I don't mean to flex
Bae I'm a rude boy, I don't got respect (Blatt)
Get off my tip and go get you a check
You know that it's  the best
I'm goin' ape when I beat on my chest
Send him to glory, lil' boy you get blessed
You savin' thots like yo' chest got a S
Go get you some money, boy you look a mess (Nananananana, let's go Faygo)
Baby girl, won't you leave me alone
You bitin' the swag, lil' boy you a clone
Guarantee nobody puttin' me on
I'ma smoke 'til a young nigga gone
Love my Nina, I got me a Latina and I'ma treat her soon as I get her home
She said she love me, and she put that on God
Won't say it back, I know that she a thot
And to be honest it ain't meanin' a lot
I see the lie when I look in her eyes
She did me wrong, but ain't no surprise
Can't trust a soul, so I came with that fye
I'm a goblin 'til I'm up in the sky
Talkin' about nothin', nigga, blah blah blah
She said she love me, and she put that on God
Won't say it back, I know that she a thot
And to be honest it ain't meanin' a lot
I see the lie when I look in her eyes
She did me wrong, but ain't no surprise
Can't trust a soul, so I came with that fye
I'm a goblin 'til I'm up in the sky
Talkin' about nothin', nigga, blah blah blah1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
