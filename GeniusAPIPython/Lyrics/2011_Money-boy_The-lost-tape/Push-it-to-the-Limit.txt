(Hook)
Nigga plotting on the set
That 223 gon get you wet
He be hanging with the feds
I should’ve known the day we met
Can’t leave out any witness
So I left that nigga gone
Yea I came in dress in black
She said im bad yea to the bone
Yea yea
Aye, my nigga brazy yea he on the beat
Im in the corner yea im on the east
And i count it up money counter go beep
Uhh
And I need a band if you wanted a feat
Don’t dm me nigga ain’t nothing for free
Cause im bout my money, boy don’t even speak
(Verse)
Ok I wish a nigga would, try to play me like a sucka
Clear his teeth out like a baby
He started crying shut the fuck up
With my brothers we sluggers, yea imma hit it out the park
Feel like bruce wayne swervin thru it bitch I come out when it’s dark
I Seen a lot, I did a lot while I was struggling finessing
Ain’t nobody couldn’t hear me so I came out started yelling
Trynna get a lil buzz but the city never known
Now I’m out here trynna get it, spitting thru the microphone
Skrt skrt
Yea, Moving different check the pivot
And my dreams they turning vivid
Talk about it cause I live it, hol up
He want war then ima end it
Tell that boy dont Push the limit
Get him finished like graa
