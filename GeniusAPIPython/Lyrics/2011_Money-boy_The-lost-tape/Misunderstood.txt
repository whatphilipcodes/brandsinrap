Yeshua, the Messiah is the only well
Capable of giving living water unto those who dwell
In darkness, and He said we can all sip but naw
Just like Lucifer you want to sit on his throne as well
How you figure you worthy to sip from His Holy Grail
The only throne you worthy of sitting on is in hell
He made you from dirt
When you die, back in the dirt you dwell
He created Earth, you ain't even create the words you sell
Take it from me before you meet the Father
Whether you Jay or Kanye, you’re just a piece of clay tryna be the Potter
I’m not your judge, I just know that when you meet your Honor
It’ll be too late for you to say or do a thing about it
Jesus is worth more than anything that you can leave your daughters
Money’s cool but reachin dollars never equal peace inside ya
How did you think it would feel when you reached a million
The same way you think it’ll feel when you reach a billion? (Prolly)
But urgency, ya searched for peace, but nothing seems to fill it
I just pray you don't jump from the building once you’ve reached the ceiling
It’s no coincidence that out of all of these religions
Jesus Christ, the only one they ever seem to mention
They be like, “Chill, it’s just a market, a scheme for selling”
Since when is it respected to be ready and willing to do anything to seek attention
Your definition of real is based on you liking something
So now us fakers only faking till your idol does it
And you’ll be like, “So what, he’s rich and drives a Billy Coop
He’s a boss, he can do that, you just mad it isn’t you
Yeah, I know he wore a skirt, but in your rep that it’s just cool
You’re just mad he has a lot of women and that he’s pimpin too”
Next week you be like, “So what, it’s his business if he’s kissing dudes”
Switching tunes, 'cause you just as fake as who you listen to
Oh yeah, now I’m judging huh?
But when your favorite rapper say you ain’t a man unless your chain is platinum then that ain’t nothin huh?
God over money boy, we don’t come to work the plate
Oh, you thought Christian rap was soft? You gon learn today
You gon learn today
Gemstones
Preach!

Bizzle what’s good? Bizzle what’s good?
Bizzle what’s good? Bizzle what’s good?
I don’t know why these rap cats keep playin' with God
They got life misunderstood
And so I pray for them, I even fall on my face for them
Hopin' to God it ain’t too late for them
'Cause there’s a place for them, burning forever that awaits for them
And whoever straddling the gate with them
See I relate to them, cause I was also up in the race with them
And I’mma way up in a lake with them, forever baked with them
Cause I was eating in the plate with them
Livin' like I was living great with them
Cause I had faith in them, to wake up livin everyday condemned
Cause you know death is for the wage of sin
I was afraid to grim, but cannot put me in the grave with men
The wolves in hell never made it in, that disobey commands
You know the ones that rather praise the beings
That never run in to embrace his hand
And until the lose a friend
They cry fo a coupla days and then, they back to their old ways again
Because they waverin, we disobey commands
Stuck in the ways of sin, up in this crazy land
How can you look up in the sky to even say you don’t believe in God?
And none of it was made by Him
Oh maybe that’s why they find it cool to make a mockery of God
I guess that’s just the ways of men, and I give Him praise and dance
'Cause then He guarantees that I’mma see tomorrow, knowin today can end
He throwin shots at God, you say you see it as a rapper going hard
I see it as a waste of pen, and then let the bass begin
Wanted to get in, but I laugh at God and fall
I figured I should wait to dance
And to my faith in hands, and like to wake the fans
And I can lace some hands, destroy Satan’s plans
Or coordinatin a brand, or forsake the land
So more snakes can stand, and false hate demands
For Lord's sakin prayin, some more grace at hand
'Cause your ways and plans are no ways of man
If we don’t praise and dance, then you’ll make the sands, Cause your grace expands to more states and lands
Then tour dates and bands, it’s called bass and friends, I’m off raisin brand, I’ll put your grace and then
That’s four shades of 10, I’m gon make the man
Hahahahah
Gemstones for life, God over money
Bizzle what’s good?
You already know what it is
