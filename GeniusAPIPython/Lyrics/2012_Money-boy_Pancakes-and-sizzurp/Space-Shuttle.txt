Got astro boys like Vladimir K
1 day 2 hours 47 minutes in space
First man down boy don't disgrace
1500+ launches have been made
Four boosters lateral to the first stage
Kerosene oxygen we got them tanks
We spend a lot of money boy we break the bank
And the first stage is gone they separate
Four vernier thrusters lead us third stage
Engine ignites, ballin' like King James
November '66 28th's the day
Who woulda thought soviets in space
I be up in space, ridin' round in my soyuz
We up here where they can't hear, tell me what's on yo mind boo
Homeboy talkin' bout missions like Apollo through TM-13
Soyuz gang boy we in the lead, don't follow no rules like gravity
Where da other guys, not in the skies
Soyuz gang man we so fly
Space station they locked 'n docked
Apollo and Soyuz they interlocked
'75 yeah that be the year
It be the lifeboat don't have no fear
We ride around in fast cars
Soyuz rap yea we got bars
Baby hop in we'll travel the stars
Ridin' in a rari I'll drive it far
Astronomy we reppin' twenty-fourteen
The shuttles only got room for three
Oh so long it's twenty three feet
Come at my clique you'll see defeatEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
