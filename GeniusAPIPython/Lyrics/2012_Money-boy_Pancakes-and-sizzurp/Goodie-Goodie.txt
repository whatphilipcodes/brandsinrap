Goofie I’m Goofie
I’m wearing that Gucci
My hand on the Uzi
Goofie that booty be Juicy
Eating the booty like Shushi
Bitches up in my Jacuzzi
I lay on my house I'm like snoopy
I’m always fucking with the groupies
Just know I’ll be next on a movie
Fruity batootie
I sit on the booty
Fuck bitches they knew me
Her pussy is droopy
I’m slippin' the roofie
Your bitch in my roomy
Suck like a smoothie
Spittin' like curry
Feelin' like Scooby
I’m growing a groupie
Smoking a doobie
I’m fucking with Uzi
Actin so moody
Actin so loopy
Bitch I'm so goofy
Bitch I'm so goofy
Bitch I'm so goofy

Goofie Goofie Goofie
Bitch I'm tryna cop the roofie
I’ve been chilling with my man
Cosbie bout to be a movie
I don’t even do them Zans
But I'm chill, call me Blue Cheese
I don’t even know about the Lord’s plan cause I’m a noobie to life
People in my class, they be eating perks
I’m buying ice
Wasted all the tips I got from work on something overpriced
I don’t need drugs my life is a fucking paradise
Don’t need hoes or money boy I’m tryna cop a wife
Fuck the wife I don’t know man I’m just tryna cop a chain
I wear it twice, Hawaiian shirt, bald head call me Max Pain
Hang with me I’ll take you out for some Tacos and Champagne
Cause even though I rap doesn’t fuckin' make me obtain cash
Writing over what I wrote, now it’s better, rehash
Pull up to the place, cup in my hand is decaf
Sleepin' at your crib, no I don’t leave cause I’m tryna smash
Pussy be the water I'm a dive in with a big splash
Big ass
Dive in with a gas mask
Sippin on that coffee do you want some girl I shout at
Sippin on that PJ hit it once I got a mustache
Lookin like a goofy little man I'm tryna beat that

Why you acting like you knew me
Why you driving like Vespucci

Bitch I’m on that gas no rookie
Bitch I eat that ass like cookie
Jesus Christ you think i'm goofy
I’ll eat you like a Zombie
Change my name to Uncle Ghandi
While I'm chillin' in my Tommy’s
I just love to call your Mommy
Roll up on you with my gang
Pull up like a boomerang
AK pushing out the rounds
Call it chitty chitty bang
