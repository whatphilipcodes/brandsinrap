Verse 1 (D-Flash)
True story my team is straight you team is weak
And your team is fake you shouldn’t even speak in my teams space
Paper chase, cuz paper makes me go around the world
And that son is what my team makes
So imma go hard stop me if you can cuz I know that’s your plan
So imma go God_zilla on these nikkas trilla on these flows
Building all my richess, pimping on these hoes
Leggo Leggo my name echoes echoes
The weed is flavoured so yeah im mellow hello
Mr. bad guy, mr. mad fly, mr. racks on stacks so
Mr. Franchise you betta throw your money damn
Ah now drop it down on that that pick it up flow
Clap that ass and then sweep it up hoe
Chillin back counting stacks
Sippin yack puffing sacks
Playign craps so holla back
Bitches swallow my sead so she knows jus where her diet is at
Chorus (Laylow)
We got those business business, got those business minds
Mind on my money, money on my mind (2x)
All I think about is money boy (3x)
I could care less what you thinking boy
Verse 2 (Laylow)
I blow a cubano every time a nikka closes a deal
I keep it real skin a nikka if that nikka squeal
Get to your hoe i give a fuck about what nikkas feel
Suck a dick boy u know that a nikka is trill
I walk around like i won the lotto
Fuck a hoe after she drowns in that moscato
Girl don’t even read what is written on that bottle
She’s drinking from the glass or she’s drinking when she’s down low
Shit we blow smoke like we about to start a fire
Boy these hoes know who the fuck they should admire
If your talking money boy your preaching to the quire
You say you touching money but i know ya nikkas lying
Catch me in 5 years you know I’ll be g fiving
Laying down in my jet while ya’ll still lying
Hoes getting my food like a fucking lion
Clean her  tears with a 100 if a bitch is crying
