They told me, grab your moment with both hands
Like when you hold your as you slow dance
The biggest sinner is a winner that holds back
Me and an ex don't click unless I close tabs
I'm so about the future, just know that
Super optimistic when you said my dreams are not realistic
Every rhyme is special even God would lipsync
Mama's instinct told her that her son was gifted
Worst case is first place no matter what the list is
Man, what is this? Gold medal rap olympics
100 metre dash, I'm sprinting
Tembisa boy, the in thing
Forward thinking, boy I've been king
Finances over fine asses
And I choose a ratchet kasi girl over a fine actress
Bathi, "Look what he became maku fika i-fame"
Hundre K macassette, is it TDK or TV game?
Is he insane? Ngiphethe ingane ezuw' two ezine titty game
I play them both, same time nje ngo PH on CDjs
Wanna be rich and healthy, fit and wealthy
Came out of the blue ingathi mama ungizale
Ang' coke i-kit le Chelsea, ngi favour Liverpool
Idlozi lami, I never walk alone
And I've always smelled like money
Boy, I never wear cologne
Besiloko sihamba sizofosta silamba
Sigcoka islamba eJozi kubanda
Si toppa iyitrada sigcobha inumber
Ngifun' uk'bona iLondon hayi uJobe London or uLundie London
Hip Hop vs Yanos mina angiboni sibangan'
Boda smandane, thola ezibandayo for the gents
Just make sure that you're gonna have enough for the rent
UDecember ufikile, donsa icooler bag, icamp chair
Siyo crowda iPhillys
Kasi boy, I hope I never change the day I touch a milly
Rubix taught me fundamentals, I was taking notes
How dare you think my rise was accidental, tell a better joke
Mawufuna siku cutter out, baba let us know
Iskero s'khona and I'm bumping SZA on my new headphones
Where can I find peace, love and hapiness
If it comes in packages, please send it to my dad's address
He deserves it all for beating all these challenges
And managing to play the father figure role immaculate
I know you always saw me cry
If I don't become the greatest ever then just know I tried
I hope my hard work and luck get to coincide
I guess we'll see
But what I'm dropping Friday is gonna blow your mindEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
