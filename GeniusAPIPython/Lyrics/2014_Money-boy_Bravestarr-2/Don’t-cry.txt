Bad boy Giftleen
Yea you know this
Bad boy Giftleen
I tell my nigga don't cry
Don't cry
Just leave your life my nigga cause at the end we all die
I tell my nigga don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry nigga
Just leave your life my nigga
The way of life is very appealing
They care about the money boy not your feelings
Spaces in my heart the money is filling
Been broke Yea I know the feeling
Street not safe police are killing
If is not about the money no one is willing
They say they fans
But I don't see them on my celling
They say they love you
Only when you foot the billing
So I tell my nigga don't cry
The pains in my heart but I don't cry
Real life lines boy I don't lie
I be back so let the sleeping dog lie
Tell my nigga don't cry
Don't cry
Just leave your life my nigga cause at the end we all die
I tell my nigga don't cry
Don't cry
Just leave your life my nigga

Woke up hungry boy with no food in the kitchen
Before you get some fish then you gonna do some fishing
You not straight forward something is fishing
Work for it boy no need for wishing
First things first trust your intuition
Always stay focus man on mission
We all living this world full of competition
The revelation won't be shown on television
It's time to make the clear decision
I hope you are getting this transmission
Leave your life cause the next minute you might be the next man on transition
Making money is still the tradition
Rubbing your hands together boy it's called friction
Even when you slid into the pussy boy it's call friction
I tell my nigga don't cry
Don't cry
Just leave your life my nigga cause at the end we all die
I tell my nigga don't cry
Don't cry
Just leave your life my nigga
Bad boy Giftleen
We all die
