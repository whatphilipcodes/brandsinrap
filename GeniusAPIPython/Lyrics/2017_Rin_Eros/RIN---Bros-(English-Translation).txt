Ey, ey, ey
Jaja, jaja, jaja

I'm going out with my boys today, baby (woah)
And she asks, she asks:
Are you still coming to my house today? Baby, baby
But I'm shooting, shooting, baby alley oop
I'm going out with my boys today, baby (woah)
And she asks, she asks:
Are you still coming to my house today? Baby, baby
But I'm shooting, shooting, baby alley oop

It's 3 at night in the city
I'm over 18 and I do what I want
10 pack of Marlboro Gold and a gin
Everybody does shit, I do what I want
Baby heard my tape and then Drake
Baby heard my tape and then Drake
Cross-over bag 'Preme, everybody looks
I have self-esteem and baby is in love

The 430 brings me home
No ticket, no problem (oh boy)
Smoke Marlboro Gold without a break
Medicine for my system
I'm going out with my boys today, baby (woah)
And she asks, she asks:
Are you still coming to my house today? Baby, baby
But I'm shooting, shooting, baby alley oop
I'm going out with my boys today, baby (woah)
And she asks, she asks:
Are you still coming to my house today? Baby, baby
But I'm shooting, shooting, baby alley oop

We're going round, because today everyone is a fukura
We chill on the stairs and not on gala
Take just one sip my bae
She wants to know everything, look at face
I trade bogos on Basement with anyone
I trade bogos on Basement with anyone
I buy 1.5 thousand euro Gosha Rubchinsky
With the dough from Shindy

The 430 brings me home
No ticket, no problem (oh boy)
Smoke Marlboro Gold without a break
Medicine for my system
I'm going out with my boys today, baby (woah)
And she asks, she asks:
Are you still coming to my house today? Baby, baby
But I'm shooting, shooting, baby alley oop
